# Mango Varieties Classification using Random Forest Classifier

This project is focused on classifying different varieties of mangoes based on their features using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset contains information about various mango varieties, which will be used to train a machine learning model that can predict the variety of a mango given its features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed via Kaggle:

- [Mango Varieties Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/mango-varieties-classification)

The dataset includes several attributes for mango samples such as weight, color, and other characteristics that will be used for classification.

## Objective

The primary goal is to build a Random Forest Classifier model that can:

- Classify mangoes into various varieties.
- Understand the relationship between mango attributes and the variety classification.
- Achieve high accuracy and generalize well on unseen data.

## Requirements

To run the code and replicate the results, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` – for visualizations
- `seaborn` – for statistical data visualizations
- `scikit-learn` – for machine learning algorithms and metrics

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
