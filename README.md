# Mango Varieties Classification using Random Forest Classifier 🍋

This project is focused on classifying different varieties of mangoes based on their images using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset contains images of various mango varieties, which will be used to train a machine learning model that can predict the variety of a mango given its image.

## Dataset 📂

The dataset used in this project can be accessed via Kaggle:

- [Mango Varieties Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/mango-varieties-classification)

The dataset includes images for several mango varieties, which will be used for training the model.

## Objective 🎯

The primary goal is to build a Random Forest Classifier model that can:

- Classify mangoes into various varieties based on their images.
- Perform image preprocessing, including resizing and normalization.
- Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

## Requirements 🛠️

To run the code and replicate the results, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` – for visualizations (if desired)
- `scikit-learn` – for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- `PIL` (Pillow) – for image processing
- `time` – to measure execution times

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn Pillow
```
